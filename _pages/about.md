About Me: 
======
Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Genomics and Computational Biology graduate group](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu), working in Professor [Dokyoon Kim](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9240045)'s [Integrative 'Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://www.biomedinfolab.com).

My general research interests include:
* Biomedical image analysis
* Interpretable machine learning 
* Precision medicine and risk prediction
* Translational modeling 
* Multi-modal data integration


My thesis work focuses on data-driven approaches for determining metabolic abnormality risk using genetics and computed tomography scans. Additionally, I am interested in histopathological analysis and survival prediction.
