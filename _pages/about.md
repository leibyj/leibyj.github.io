Hello! I have recently completed my Ph.D. in the Genomics and Computational Biology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. My dissertation, "Advancement and Application of Deep Learning Techniques for Biomedical Image Analysis: Diagnostics, Risk, and Biomarker Prediction," focused on data-driven approaches for determining the risk and occurrence of metabolic abnormalities using computed tomography scans, as well as biomarker prediction from histology images for precision medicine tasks in cancer.

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the labs of Drs. [Zhi Huang](https://www.zhihuang.ai/) and [Dokyoon Kim](https://www.biomedinfolab.com/), where I work on representation learning and vision-language modeling for multiplexed spatial omics and histology imaging data.

My general research interests include:
* Biomedical image analysis
* Precision medicine and risk prediction
* Translational modeling 
* Multi-modal data integration
