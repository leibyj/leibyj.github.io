Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Genomics and Computational Biology graduate group](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu), working in Professor [Dokyoon Kim](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9240045)'s [Integrative 'Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://www.biomedinfolab.com).

My general research interests include:
* Biomedical image analysis
* Precision medicine and risk prediction
* Translational modeling 
* Multi-modal data integration


My thesis work focuses on the development and application of deep learning approaches for risk prediction and precision medicine using clinical imaging data. Specifically, my thesis topics are: data-driven approaches for determining risk and occurrence of metabolic abnormality using computed tomography scans, and biomarker prediction from histological images for precision medicine tasks in cancer.
